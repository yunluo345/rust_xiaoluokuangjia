# Repository Guidelines

## Naming Rules

### Core Principle
All identifiers (including class names, variable names, and constants) must use fully lowercase pinyin by default.

Example: `class yonghu`, `let shuju`, `const zuidazhi`

### Capitalization Exception
Only when required by language specifications or frameworks (e.g., Rust enum variants, Rust struct names) may the first letter be capitalized.

Example: `struct Yonghu`, `enum Caozuoleixing`, variant `Xiugaizhanghao`

### Strictly No Camel Case
Even when capitalization is required, the remaining letters must be continuous lowercase pinyin. camelCase is strictly prohibited.

- ❌ Incorrect: `YongHu`, `peiZhi`, `ZuiDaZhi`, `XiugaiZhanghao`
- ✅ Correct: `Yonghu`, `peizhi`, `zuidazhi`, `Xiugaizhanghao`

### Constant Naming
Constants must also use lowercase pinyin.

### Quotation Content Rule
All content inside quotation marks (e.g., string literals, prompts, error messages) must be written in Chinese, not pinyin.

Example: `println!("支付成功")`, `错误信息 = "订单不存在"`

## Comment Rules
Comments must be concise and can only be placed at the top of a method or function declaration.
Inline comments inside code blocks are strictly prohibited.

## Code Quality Requirements

- Unit tests are not allowed.
- Use advanced and efficient implementations; avoid repetitive and excessive if statements.
- Minimize duplication.
- Suppress and fix warnings.

## Utility Class Rules
When writing utility classes, return `None` or `false` on failure instead of printing error messages.
Error handling is the caller's responsibility. Only print errors if explicitly required.

Example: `return None` instead of `println!("错误信息")`

## Additional Development Requirements

- Files must be created within the specified directory structure.
- Strictly follow layered architecture principles. Do not create non-standard directories.
- Class names, method names, and variable names must match the existing naming style. Avoid arbitrary abbreviations. Names must be clear and readable.
- Hardcoding is prohibited. All constants must be centrally managed.
- Prioritize reusability. Properly split methods, extract private methods, avoid duplication (DRY), follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
- Avoid low-performance implementations. Prefer optimal time complexity. Code must be elegant, scalable, and maintainable.
- Keep code concise. Avoid deep nesting. Use functional style where appropriate. Handle exceptions properly.
- Overall structure must be clear, logically layered, scalable, and maintainable.
- Do not run backend or frontend applications. Only check the code for errors. The user will run it themselves.
